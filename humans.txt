# THANKS

    To my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for loving me unconditionally, in every situation, and despite it all;
    and for loving us all and giving us Your great grace. Thank You, Father.

    To my wife and best friend, my companion and "study/work buddy".

    To my family, for helping me to become who I am today. 
    Thanks, Mom and Dad, Matt, Aunt Di, Nana, Papa, and Buddy.
