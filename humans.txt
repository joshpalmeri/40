# THANKS

    To my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for loving me unconditionally, in every situation, and despite it all; and for loving us all and giving us Your great grace. Thank You, Father.

    To my wife and best friend, my companion and "study/work buddy". My support, encourager and uplifter. You enable me to be great. I love you.

    To my family, for helping me to become who I am today. Thanks, Mom and Dad, Matt, Aunt Di, Nana, Papa, and Buddy.

    TO my church family and friends. Your encouragement has meant the world to my life and lifted me when I needed it most. Bless you.
